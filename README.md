# Random-Tests
Random code and algorithms that is cool/useful that I want to always have access to

## Python
- **FizzBuzz:** expandable code version
- **Particle Effect (Pygame):** movable particle effect flare with direction, colour, gravity, size controls and resets
- **Kruskal's Algorithm:** finds MST and its weight via arcs
- **Prim's Algorithm:** finds MST and its weight via nodes
- **Dijkstra's SPT Algorithm:** finds shortest path from a source node to another vertex
- **Pygame Template:** skeleton for pygame file
- **Recursion:** factorial calculator and Tower of Hanoi solved via recursion
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Bubble, Insertion, Merge and Quick sorts
- **Search Algorithms:** Linear and Binary searches
- **Scheduler:** OS scheduling algorithms - SJF, FCFS, RR
- **Triangulation:** determines what kind of triangle is created, given side lengths
